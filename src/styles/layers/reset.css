/* ==========================================================================
   RESET
   ==========================================================================
   Purpose:
   Establishes a flexible, theme-agnostic baseline that unifies core behaviors
   across browsers, platforms, and rendering engines. This reset ensures 
   predictable cross-environment consistency while remaining fully adaptable 
   to varying product requirements, brand systems, or component architectures.

   Notes:
   The reset is deliberately minimal and token-driven, allowing downstream
   layers (components, themes, or platform overrides) to extend or refine
   behavior without breaking global consistency.
