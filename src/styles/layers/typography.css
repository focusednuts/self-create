/* ==========================================================================
   TYPOGRAPHY
   ==========================================================================
   Purpose:
   Establishes adaptable global typography foundations that remain consistent
   across brands, themes, and platforms. This layer defines high-readability
   text defaults while allowing product teams and component systems to build
   richer typographic experiences on top.

   Notes:
   - All visual treatments (colors, surfaces) are powered by semantic tokens to
   ensure predictable behavior in multi-brand and multi-theme environments.
   - Typography features (ligatures, alternates, rendering quality) are applied
   at a global level to create a refined baseline without enforcing stylistic
   decisions on individual components.
   - This structure supports scalable, composable typographic architectures,
   where components and themes remain free to extend, override, or specialize
   without breaking global consistency.
