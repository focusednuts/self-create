/* ==========================================================================
   ACCESSIBILITY (A11Y)
   ==========================================================================
   Purpose:
   Defines foundational accessibility behaviors that remain adaptable across
   different products, themes, and interaction models. These rules create a
   predictable baseline for usability while allowing individual components or
   platforms to extend, override, or specialize the experience as needed.

   Notes:
   - These behaviors are intentionally minimal and token-driven to support
   diverse ecosystems—from multi-brand systems to cross-platform products.
   - Visual treatment (color) is defined via semantic tokens, while motion,
   animation, and component-level refinement can be layered on without
   disrupting the global accessibility foundation.
   - This structure promotes scalable, interchangeable theming architectures
   where accessibility remains consistent regardless of UI style or brand
   expression.
